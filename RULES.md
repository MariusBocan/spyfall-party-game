This platform is designed entirely for mobile devices. It’s a small, spontaneous project inspired by the lack of apps for this game. It is played in real life with a group of friends. The rules are simple: there is one spy in the game, and the rest of the players are given a location. They have to ask each other questions about the location to identify the spy. If the spy guesses the location, they win. If the spy is caught or fails to guess the location, he lose. <br>
Rules: <br>
    1. Write Player Names: Start by writing down the names of all the players. <br>
    2. Use One Phone: Use one phone to show everyone their role secretly. Don’t peek at other players’ roles! <br>
    3. Ask Questions: Ask general questions about the location. Avoid being too specific. <br>
    4. Vote Out the Spy: If you think someone is the spy, vote to kick them out. If he isn't the spy, the game continues without him. If he is, obviously, you won! <br>
    5. Spy's Goal: As a spy, listen to the answers and try to guess the location. If you think you know, say, “I am the spy, the location is X!” If you’re right, you win. If you’re wrong, you lose. <br>
    6. Have Fun: Enjoy the game! <br>
